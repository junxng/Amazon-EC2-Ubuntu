# You would typically mock external dependencies like QdrantClient and embedding models
# using unittest.mock.patch or similar techniques.

# Example of a test structure (requires actual implementation of mocking):
# @pytest.mark.asyncio
# @patch('app.rag.documents.QdrantClient') # Adjust path based on where QdrantClient is imported/used
# @patch('app.rag.documents.OpenAIEmbeddings') # Adjust path similarly
# async def test_process_pdf_success(mock_openai_embeddings, mock_qdrant_client):
#     # Configure your mocks to return expected values or behaviors
#     mock_qdrant_client_instance = MagicMock()
#     mock_qdrant_client.return_value = mock_qdrant_client_instance

#     mock_openai_embeddings_instance = MagicMock()
#     mock_openai_embeddings.return_value = mock_openai_embeddings_instance

#     # Simulate writing mock content to a temporary file
#     # This part might require using tempfile or a testing utility
#     # with open("temp_mock.pdf", "w") as f:
#     #     f.write(mock_pdf_text_content) # This is text, not a real PDF binary

#     # For testing process_pdf, you'd likely mock the PDF reading part as well
#     # or provide a path to a small, real mock PDF file.
#     # Let's assume we are testing the logic *after* text extraction for this example:

#     # Call the function under test
#     # result = process_pdf("path/to/mock_pdf", extracted_text=mock_pdf_text_content)

#     # Assertions based on expected behavior
#     # assert result["success"] is True
#     # You would also assert that mock methods on QdrantClient and OpenAIEmbeddings were called correctly
#     # mock_qdrant_client_instance.upsert.assert_called_once()
#     # mock_openai_embeddings_instance.embed_documents.assert_called_once()

# Example of a test for error handling (e.g., with an empty file)
# @pytest.mark.asyncio
# @patch('app.rag.documents.QdrantClient')
# @patch('app.rag.documents.OpenAIEmbeddings')
# async def test_process_pdf_empty_file(mock_openai_embeddings, mock_qdrant_client):
#     # Simulate processing of an empty file or empty extracted text
#     # result = process_pdf("path/to/empty.pdf", extracted_text="")

#     # Assert expected error result
#     # assert result["success"] is False
#     # assert "empty" in result["error"].lower()
#     # You would also assert that external service mocks were NOT called
#     # mock_qdrant_client.assert_not_called()
#     # mock_openai_embeddings.assert_not_called()

# Note: To run these tests, you would need to:
# 1. Implement the actual mocking logic using unittest.mock.patch or a testing framework's features.
# 2. Ensure the paths in patch decorators ('app.rag.documents.QdrantClient') are correct based on your project structure.
# 3. If process_pdf reads files directly, you might need to mock file reading or use temporary files.
